Assignment: Assignment 3: HTTP Server With Logging and Caching

How to use:
1. Clone or pull the code on Ubuntu or on the Unix Timeshare
2. Run make then ./httpserver <ip/localhost> <portnumber> <-c> <-l %s>
	The -c and -l flags can be put anywhere after ./httpserver
3. Server is now running, so you can now run requests on the server with
   caching either turned off or turned on.
