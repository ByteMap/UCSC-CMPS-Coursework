Question:
Using your new httpserver with caching, perform an experiment to
demonstrate how caching can improve performance. Do a test with
caching turned on and compare it with the same test but with caching
turned off.

Answer:
With my new httpserver with caching, I can see a somewhat significant
time reduction compared to the httpserver without caching. For example
when doing a GET request, I get 1.052s with the httpserver without
caching and a 1.021s with the httpserver with caching. A similar time
is outputted with doing a PUT request for a cached httpserver and a
non-cached httpserver.
